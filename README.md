# AI-Powered-Bilingual-Chatbot
Designed and developed a fully interactive AI chatbot from scratch, focusing on intuitive user experience and practical AI integration.

• Custom-Trained Model: Engineered a local model trained on 100,000+ unique, domain-specific words to deliver accurate and context-aware responses tailored to the Artificial Intelligence Club.

• GPT-4o Integration: Enhanced functionality with the integration of an advanced GPT-4o-like model for more natural and intelligent conversations.

• User-Centric UI: Built a responsive, bilingual interface (Arabic & English) optimized for accessibility across devices, ensuring seamless user interaction.

• Real-World Deployment: Successfully deployed the chatbot across multiple platforms during major events like Saudi Foundation Day and International AI Day, showcasing its portability and ease of integration.

This project highlights my capabilities in AI model development, UI/UX design, and real-world application deployment.
